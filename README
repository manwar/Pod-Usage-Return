NAME
    Pod::Usage::Return - pod2usage that returns instead of exits

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        use Pod::Usage::Return qw( pod2usage );

        exit pod2usage(0);

        sub main {
            return pod2usage("ERROR: An error occurred!") if $ERROR;
        }

        exit pod2usage( -exitval => 1, -message => 'ERROR: An error occurred' );

DESCRIPTION
    This is a drop-in replacement for Pod::Usage "pod2usage" that returns
    the exit value instead of calling exit.

RATIONALE
    Testing that your command-line script works is a good thing. It's a lot
    easier to test a module, so writing your command-line script as a module
    ("modulino") makes it easier to test.

    Unfortunately, Pod::Usage automatically calls "exit", which again makes
    it harder to test your script. There is a way to prevent Pod::Usage from
    exiting, but it makes using Pod::Usage a lot less convenient.

    This module provides a drop-in "pod2usage" replacement that returns the
    exit code instead of exiting, so that you can easily test your script
    while using Pod::Usage.

FUNCTIONS
  pod2usage
    See Pod::Usage for documentation. Returns the exit code instead of
    calling exit().
